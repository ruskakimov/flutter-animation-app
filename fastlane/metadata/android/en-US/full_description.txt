Think of it as a combination of a video editor and a drawing app.
Perfect for a short cartoon, movie animatic, or a music video storyboard.

Some artists say this is the EASIEST way to make a quick storyboard animation out there. But don't take others' words as gospel truth, give it a try and find it out yourself!

Features:
- Simple drawing tools
- Precisely time the duration of each scene and frame
- Loop animations
- Layers acting as independent timelines (e.g. action in the background can be animated separately from the main action)
- Annotate scenes with dialog or other description
- Import music (for now only a single soundtrack)
- Export animatic as an mp4

This app is under active development.
